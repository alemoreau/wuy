This is not a real life app ;-)

This is a boilerplate of mixing wuy/vbuild to be able to make GUI app with vuejs rendering (with vue/sfc components), thanks to [vbuild](https://github.com/manatlan/vbuild)

Before everything, make sure you have done :

```
pip3 install wuy vbuild
```

and start the `app.py` (from its own folder)
