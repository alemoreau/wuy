It's like [python eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel) BUT :

    - it's not as polished
    - it uses python3 ONLY
    - it uses asyncio, and the marvellous [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    - it's server hosted friendly
    - it uses pubsub mechanism to communicate from server to clients, or from client to clients
    - it's not pyinstaller-friendly for now
